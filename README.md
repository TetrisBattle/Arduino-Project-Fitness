# Fitness-Arduino-Project
This project is written in finnish.

This is an arduino project.
It was designed to be used on wrist with LCD touchscreen.

The device can calculate how many times user has done push ups, sit ups, jumps and squats.
Device trains you in 3 sets and the amount you need to do push ups depends on the difficultty which is set from the main screen. If user fails to do the sets, then the next exercise will be easier. If the user manages to complete the sets, then the next exercise will be harder.

You can create multiple users to device and it will calculate how much calories you have burned during these exercises.
